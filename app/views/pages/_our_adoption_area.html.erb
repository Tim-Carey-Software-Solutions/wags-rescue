<p><i>Wags Rescue</i> is based in <i>Bucks County</i>. Therefore, a majority of our volunteers live in the Bucks
  County area.
  <i>WAGS</i> will consider adoption applications for people living in the <i>BUCKS</i> and <i>MONTGOMERY</i>
  areas. On a case by case basis
  <i>(depending on distance and availability of our volunteers to do a home visit)</i>, we may consider
  applications in the
  <i>PHILADELPHIA</i> area as well as parts of <i>CHESTER</i> county.
