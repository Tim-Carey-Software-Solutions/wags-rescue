<textarea class="placeholder-black p-8" placeholder="I understand the responsibilities that I am assuming by adopting a rescue dog.
I know that there may be unforeseen circumstances and expenses with the introduction
of a new pet in my household. All medical expenses related to this animal will be my responsibility from the time of adoption. Wags will not reimburse veterinary medical
expenses for this animal.
I understand that Wags Rescue is a non-profit all volunteer rescue group.
I understand that the donation made when I adopt a dog is necessary to help offset
costs incurred to rescue and care for each dog.

I understand the the adoption fee is a NON-REFUNDABLE donation given to Wags so
that we may continue our mission of saving dogs.

If the time comes that I can no longer care for the dog, I understand that I will
receive NO REFUND and that I must return the dog to Wags.

I understand to return my dog to Wags, I must contact Colleen Simeti at (267) 238-7892,
and I must submit to a 30 day waiting period in which one of two things will transpire:
     1) A Wags representative will work with the family to resolve any issues with the
        dog that may be the cause for the returning the pet.
     2) If the issues can not be resolved, Wags will accept your surrender of the pet.

I understand that I am not authorized to release this dog to any other party, whether
related to me or not. I agree that in any circumstance, if I can no longer keep
this dog in its lifetime, the dog will be returned to Wags Rescue and Referral.

Our adoption fees are as follows:
